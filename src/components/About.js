        <p id='About-statement' style={{ maxWidth: 900 }}>I am a bachelor's degree graduate of Sports Exercise and Science. Recently I completed General Assembly Software Engineering bootcamp. Having worked numerous physical labor roles, I really wanted to explore my natural problem solving, adaptability, growth mindset, and work ethic. I came across the General Assembly, which sparked interest. Once I started coding, I felt like this is exactly what I wanted to do with my career. I developed a passion for coding, because it requires creativity and logical thinking skills. I am a motivated, hard working, and enthusiastic individual who is keen on learning and is a team player. I am looking for a company that is willing to help me develop my skills in this industry.</p>
